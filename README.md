# Statistical-Predictions-Over-or-Under
Projecting whether a given statistic will go over or under the projection using data from EV Analytics.

When interning with EV Analytics over the summer. I developed a script that predicts whether a certain statistic across the NFL, MLB, or NBA will go over or under the projected amount using EV Analytics' historical data. Unfortunately, the data is confidential so these results are not replicable. I was kept on for 2 extra weeks to further developed odds and percentages for EV Analytics as my model was more accurate in certain cases than internal models.
