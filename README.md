# Statistical-Predictions-Over-or-Under
Projecting whether a given statistic will go over or under the projection using data from EV Analytics.

When interning with EV Analytics over the summer, I developed a script that predicts whether a certain statistic across the NFL, MLB, or NBA will go over or under the projected amount using EV Analytics' historical data. Unfortunately, the data is confidential so these results are not replicable. I was kept on for 2 extra weeks to further develop odds and percentages for EV Analytics as my model was more accurate in certain cases than their internal models.

The data in this model consists of historically tracked home team win percentages, projected game totals, the over/under for the given statistic, and how many of that statistic was recoreded. This model essentially takes the historical data for the projections for each of these statistics and uses the tracked data to then measure the probabilities for each over under possible for that model. For example, if the given statistic was passing touchdowns and you wanted to see the probability of a player passing for 6 touchdowns (which is very rare and doesn't have much data), this model generates a percentage of liklihood. The model is unique because it uses an interactive term "spread" against every predictor, causing a very distinct linear progression of liklihood. The truth is the model isn't so complicated, but it was effective and proved valuable to EV Analytics.
